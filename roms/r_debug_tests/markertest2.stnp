#test program for SSTNPL's 'marker' debug marker feature.

#markers show the STARTING address of the FOLLOWING instruction block.

#SSTNPL's Debug markers are a wrapper for SBTCVM assembly's markers.
#SSTNPL will automatically append the appropriate SSTNPL source file line
#number to your given label.

#--WHEN USING EMBEDDED ASSEMBLY--:
#using SSTNPL's marker instruction is recommended over
#using the marker assembler keyword directly. as with SSTNPL's marker
#instruction, the .stnp source line number of the marker will automatically be appened.

#assembly markers are zerosize, and will print their given label along with source line
#and the aforementioned address during assembler pass 2. 
#it will also be printed during pass 0, but lacking the address.
#these addresses can then be used with romdump.py's optional ranged mode.

#this marker will show the address of the following 'stop' instruction.

#example of using romdump range:

#romdump.py -r markertest [start] [end]

#To get the data between two markers, just use the first one's address as
#[start], and the last one's address as [end]
