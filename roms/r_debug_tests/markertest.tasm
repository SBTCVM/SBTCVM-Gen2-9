#test program for SBTCVM assembly's 'marker' debug marker feature.

#markers show the address of the FOLLOWING keyword. For multi-word keywords,
#this is the START ADDRESS of that keyword's output.

#markers are zerosize, and will print their given label along with source line
#and the aforementioned address during assembler pass 2. 
#it will also be printed during pass 0, but lacking the address.
#these addresses can then be used with romdump.py's optional ranged mode.




#syntax is simple. just be sure to specify a plain text label as the data.
marker;top

null;10x1
null;10x2
null;10x3
null;10x4
null;10x5
null;10x6

#this marker will show the address of the following 'stop' keyword.
marker;end
stop


#example of using romdump range:

#romdump.py -r markertest [start] [end]

#To get the data between two markers, just use the first one's address as
#[start], and the last one's address as [end]
