#tas0 files are special-case tasm source files that act as loadable 'modules'.
#tas0 source is assembled on-the-fly via the mainloop class of the assembler, via a special assembler library mode.
#this tas0 is included by testmod.tas0 to test inclusion of tas0 files within other tas0 files.
#vars prefixed with a '.' are hidden from nsp/tas0 include.
