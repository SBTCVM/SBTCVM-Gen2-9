--Namespace--

The unified namespace of the v3 assembler is designed to provide as much flexibility to programmers as possible.

for example, here is a hypothetical example for keyboard interrupt constants:


if a key is used in several sections of a program. i.e. multiple menus,
its possible to set this key using a custom variable like so:
v>actionkey;>_keyl

this way if you use the l key in many places, you can change this key via a single line of code.

This is just one example of the uses of this new, more advanced namespace system.
