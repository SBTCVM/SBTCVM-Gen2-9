modes of operation: 
	-MODE 0: SBTCVM BTserial Socket (sbtsoc) (insecure variant)
	-MODE 1: ASCII-to-BTT2 dynamically translated socket
	-MODE 10: SBTCVM BTserial Socket Secure (sbtsocs) (Via SSL Tunneling) [later]

SBTSOCK Control serial (similar to SBTVDI Serial)

commands:

	mode [number] set socket mode
	connect [hostname]:[port]
	listmodes [show supported socket modes]
	help [general help]
	timeout [milliseconds]


register plan:
R: control serial read
W: control serial write

W: socket Send
R: socket Receive
R: socket ReceiveBufferSize

R: serial ConnectionError: 0 for no error, any other number means there was an error.

------SBTSOC Protocol Details------


----message scheme----


messages are to be contained within brackets `[]`
the message type is to be split from the message contents with a `:`

----connection start----

upon connection, the machine initializing the connection will send a
version confirmation message, which describes the protocol version
requested to be used.

	[ver:0]

Following this, the machine being connected to, will send either a confirmation:

	[vready]
	
or, if the version is not supported, it will return an error message, and close
 the connection:

	[verror]


----data IO----

--for 9 trits--

	[d9:+-0+++000]

--for 12 trits--

	[d12:+++---+++000]
