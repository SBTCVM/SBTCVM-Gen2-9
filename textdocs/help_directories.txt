Help on SBTCVM's directories:



Path directories (in search order):
VMSYSTEM
VMSYSTEM/ROMS
ROMS
VMUSER

SBTCVM also searches subdirectories (project directories) in the 4 main path directories, provided
they are prefixed with 'r_'.

SBTCVM's path system allows files to be specified via just the base name. 
even the extension can be omitted in some cases.

e.g.

g2asm.py example would match VMUSER/r_myproject/example.tasm

rom files are here two. such as the default trom, and the assembler's
