------SBTNET Protocol Details------

TCP/IP-based SBTNET 'clearnet Gateway' server simulates the local network for 
SBTNET-capable Applications and VMs.

SBTNET addressing scheme [T-ADR]:

6 Nonets per address in the form [0];[1];[2];[3];[4];[5]:[port]
DDD to MMM in septemvigesimal per Nonet

10-trit [managed as 2 Nonets] Port range (-29524 to +29524) 1DDD to ZMMM in septemvigesimal

logically, each of the nonets will be managed as a separate number. 
the address format is mainly for display.


VM should handle the local server TCP/IP communication, to the effect
that as far as code in the vm is concerned, its connected to a 
'hardware' SBTNET gateway system over a physical connection.

protocol should be efficent, (with some error correction preferrably).
