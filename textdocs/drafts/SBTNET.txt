------SBTNET Protocol Details------

TCP/IP-based server simulates the network HUB.

SBTNET addressing scheme:

4 Nonets per address in the form [main].[sub].[mid].[base]
logically, each of the nonets will be managed as a separate number. 
the address format is mainly for display.


VM should handle the local server TCP/IP communication, so applications 
don't have to handle the bridging setup.

protocol should be efficent, (with some error correction preferrably).
