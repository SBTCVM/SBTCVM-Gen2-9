SBTCVM eXtensible Assembly Script help

xas scripts provide a portable, integrated build script system
for complex SBTCVM Applications.

for help on interactive mode, see help_xas_shell.txt

to run XAS scripts, use the interpreter: 'xas.py'

commands must be separated from arguments by either a space or a semicolon:
i.e.
	print;hello world
	print hello world

###basic commands:

print: print strings to standard output. i.e.
	print;hello world
exit: exit the xas script. note that this WILL NOT close 'parent' XAS scripts, but return to them.
	exit
xas: call another xas script as a 'child' script.
	xas;xasname
