### NEW SBTVDI PLAN
# as much operations are handled via VDI Serial comamnds ONLY, as reasonable.
# Some commands will have IO-register inputs and outputs. (fileIO for example)
# resetload is now a VDI command that accepts: rstload [diskindex] [filename]
# filebuffers will assign/report filenames and such via VDI Serial.



Filebuffer examples: (concept. not final)


	fp0 name help.txt
	fp0 exist
		-> true/false (CLI out)
		-> 1/0 (register out)\?????\
	fp0 name
		-> print name(+newline) (CLI out)



Resetload:

	rstld [disk index ID] [filename]
	rstld 0 command.txe
	rstld 1 command.txe
	rstld -1 command.txe
		(search all disks for file named command.txe and reset-load it.)
	cpyren [src disk index ID] [src filename] [dest disk index ID] [dest filename]
	cpyren 0 command.txe 2 command.txe
	ren [src disk index ID] [old filename] [new filename]
	cpy [src disk index ID] [dest disk index ID] [filename
	d0ld diskimage
	d1ld diskimage
	lsf [disk index ID] (list files)


implementation plan: 
	-get basic dist booting and rstld working.
	-get SBTCVM-DOS booting correctly from disk.
	-start work on file operations and filebuffers
		-???
	-test test test!!!!
	-add useful utilities to SBTCVM-DOS
