9-trit instructions, 9-trit data.

Should work in python 2.7 AND 3 With python 2 to be dropped likely arround its 2020 EOL.

Should Feature a console-only mode as well as a graphical one.


TODO:
- MOST IMPORTANTLY: start with planning.

- specify instruction set and IRQ scheme so work on the CPU's instruction parser can begin.

- identify any changes to be added to assembly language. rewrite/port assembler once instruction set is planned.

- devise a more coherent bank switching scheme. also look into multi-rom assembly support.

- plan out IO devices like a keyboard, Virtual Disk drive, and IRQ-equipped revisons of SBTGA and the Digital Sample device.
