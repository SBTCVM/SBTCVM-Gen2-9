Similar, but somewhat different to r_ (recursive) project directories,
autodirs provide a means to sort project files.


They require no prefix like project directories, however, they do only allow
certain files into the path.

Specifically:

*.trom  SBTCVM VM memory image files.
*.tasm  SBTCVM assembly source files.
*.xas   XAS script files.
*.nsp   Assembler NameSpace libraries.
*.stnp  SSTNPL source code files.

>>>>HOWEVER:

files of these types MUST BE PREFIXED WITH 'auto_' IN THEIR FILENAMES!

sidenote:
SSTNPL compiler will add a 'x_' prefix when the 'auto_' prefix is found in the
SSTNPL source file.



>>Technical notes on autodir implementation, and how to enable it.:

in order for loadtrom and findtrom to use autodir functionality, you must
specify the dirauto attribute as 1. i.e.:

iofuncts.findtrom(filename, ext=".whatever", exitonfail=1, exitmsg="THIS IS AN EXAMPLE :)",  dirauto=1)
