Help on the various python programs & utilities included with SBTCVM gen 2-9

>>>g2asm.py:
   SBTCVM's assembler. Not only does it act as the primary language SBTCVM's
   VM is programmed with, it also acts as a target for other programming
   languages, like SSTNPL. Helps to have a grasp of balanced ternary and how
   lower level programming works.

>>>xas.py:
   SBTCVM's eXtensible Assembly Script, or XAS, is in charge of scripting
   together complex build processes of more complex applications and 
   components. Though many TROM programs lack need for it, and so use
   stnpcom.py or g2asm.py directly.

>>>stnpcom.py:
   the SSTNPL compiler. This is the ideal way to learn balanced ternary math,
   along with a bit of programing too. Ideal for beginners. for more serious
   algorithms, you may find the assembler better suited.
   When used, the SSTNPL compiler will automatically run the assembler for you.

>>>romdump.py:
   A nifty SBTCVM trom dump utility with 2 formatting modes and 2 trit
   representations. akin to unix/linux 'hexdump' command.
   
>>>SBTCVM_G2_9.py:
   SBTCVM's virtual machine. (with curses frontend)
   This version must be run in a terminal!
   also, the curses frontend may lack certain features. i.e. graphics.
