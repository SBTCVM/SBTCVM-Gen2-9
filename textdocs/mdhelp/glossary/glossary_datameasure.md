# Data Measurements
[return to glossary index](glossary.md)
## These are SBTCVM's measurements for lengths of trits.
	name    | size     | shorthand(s)
	--------+----------+----------
	trit    | 1 trit   | t1  ('t' also used)
	triad   | 3 trits  | t3
	tryte   | 6 trits  | t6  ('T' also used)
	nonet   | 9 trits  | t9
	ditryte | 12 trits | t12

Note: in numbered shorthands where n is the number of trits,
it is recommended that (n) be in superscript.

## Kt, Mt, etc.
with the above shorthands, you may find a metric prefix being used with it.
in SBTCVM, this is 1093 units rather than 1024 in binary. eg.
- 1 MT = 1093 KT = 1194649 T (Trytes)
- 1 Mt1 = 1093 Kt1 = 1194649 t1 (trits)
- 1 Mt3 = 1093 Kt3 = 1194649 t3 (triads)
- 1 Mt9 = 1093 Kt9 = 1194649 t9 (nonets)
- 1 Mt12 = 1093 Kt12 = 1194649 t12 (ditrytes)    
eg.    
- SBTCVM has (3^9)*2 or 39366 t9's or aprox. 36.01 Kt9's (KiloNonets) of ram
- A 12 trit SBTCVM would have (3^12)*2 or 1062882 t12's or approx. 972.44 Kt12's (KiloDiTrytes) of ram
