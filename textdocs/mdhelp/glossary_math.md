## MPI:
The _Maximum Positive Integer_ of a length of trits.
The maximum value a length of trits can store. Formula:

	((3^t)-1)/2=m         
	Where 't' is the length of trits         
	and 'm' is the MPI of 't'        

## MNI:
The _Maximum Negative Integer_ of a length of trits.
The minimum value a length of trits can store.
the absolute value of MNI(9) equals MPI(9),
so the formulas are nearly identical.

## MCV:
The _Maximum Combinations Value_ of a length of trits.
The number of combinations in a length of trits. Formula:

	((3^t))=m       
	Where 't' is the length of trits      
	and 'm' is the MCV of 't'
