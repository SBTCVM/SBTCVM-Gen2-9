SBTCVM Balanced Ternary Graphics Adapter v2
--planning and specifications--

Modes:
Tilemap modes:
In place of the framebuffer modes, will be tilemapped modes,
in which the display is split into a grid of tiles, 
and each tile points to a tile definition.

tile IDs are 9 trits. (1 short word) (2 per long word)

each tile definition can be in either 1-trit Monochrome, 3-trit RGB, or 9-trit RGB.
Same with sprites.

This means tiles of all color modes can be used in one screen.

the palette should be specified via the load-tile IO address used.


Display modes:
