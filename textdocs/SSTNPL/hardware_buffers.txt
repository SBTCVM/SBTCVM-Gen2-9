# SSTNPL BUFFER INTEGRATION


#### overview ####
SSTNPL features integration with SBTCVM's 4 generic Double-Ended Buffers.
 - string input is provided for code that manipulates text.
 - raw value commands also available.
 - brd* (read) commands return 0 when the Hardware buffer is empty.

# TODO: add examples & more info to this document!

Note: within the following commands, replace '1' with '2', '3', or '4' to use the other
3 buffers!

Buffer Commands:
	brdhead1 : read & remove one value at HEAD of buffer 1. Use 'set' to store result.
	brdtail1 : read & remove one value at TAIL of buffer 1. Use 'set' to store result.
	bwrhead1 [varname] : write one value to HEAD of buffer 1 (supports literals)
	bwrtail1 [varname] : write one value to TAIL of buffer 1 (supports literals)
	breset1            : reset buffer so its ensured empty
	bprinthead1 [string]  : output a string to buffer 1 via HEAD.
	bprinttail1 [string]  : output a string to buffer 1 via TAIL.
	bprinthead1n [string] : output a string to buffer 1 via HEAD. WITHOUT NEWLINE.
	bprinttail1n [string] : output a string to buffer 1 via TAIL. WITHOUT NEWLINE.
