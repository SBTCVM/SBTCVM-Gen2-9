# SSTNPL iterator commands:





# overview:

SSTNPL provides several ways to look subroutines. iterators do so for given ranges.


#### SINGULAR ITERATORS ####


uiter [name],[subroutine],[start],[end]
diter [name],[subroutine],[start],[end]

uiter counts from START UP TO END, and needs END to be greater than START
diter counts from START DOWN TO END, and needs END to be less than START




# START and END can either be integer variables, or Literals

# SUBROUTINE is the associated label of the subroutine to be looped.

# NAME is a unique variable name (NO VAR STATEMENT REQUIRED)
	NAME is used to provide the subroutine with an easy way of getting the
	iterator's state.
    DO NOT WRITE TO THIS VARIABLE



#### XY (DOUBLE) ITERATORS #### 
(handy for working with tables!)


u2iter [namex],[namey],[subroutine],[startx],[endx],[starty],[endy]
d2iter [namex],[namey],[subroutine],[startx],[endx],[starty],[endy]

Don't let the 7 arguments scare you!

u2iter counts from STARTX UP TO ENDX for each number of STARTY UP TO ENDY
	and needs both ENDs to be GREATER than their respective STARTs
	
d2iter counts from STARTX DOWN TO ENDX for each number of STARTY DOWN TO ENDY
	and needs both ENDs to be LESS than their respective STARTs


Also note the separate x and y NAMEs
	As with uiter and diter, NAMEX and NAMEY don't need var statements.
	NAMEX stores the X iterator value. 
	NAMEY stores the Y iterator value.
	again, DO NOT WRITE TO NAMEX AND NAMEY!!!!!!!
	[NOTE: the x iterator is itself run for each iteration of the y iterator]
