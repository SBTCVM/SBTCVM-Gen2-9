#SSTNPL iterator commands:





#overview:

SSTNPL provides several ways to look subroutines. iterators do so for given ranges.


uiter [name],[subroutine],[start],[end]
diter [name],[subroutine],[start],[end]

uiter counts from START UP TO END, and needs END to be greater than START
diter counts from START DOWN TO END, and needs END to be less than START



#START and END can either be integer variables, or static decimal values
#	using the '@' syntax i.e. @-40

#SUBROUTINE is the associated label of the subroutine to be looped.

#NAME is a unique variable name (NO VAR STATEMENT REQUIRED)
#	NAME is used to provide the subroutine with an easy way of getting the
#	iterator's state.
