#Overview of SSTNPL's tables:

SSTNPL provides a capable 2-axis data table system.

You can use this system for game level data, algorithms, and other sorts of things.



#Table COMMANDS

-
tabr [name],[xpos],[ypos]
set [var]

[xpos] and [ypos] can either be an integer variable or a Literal


--write at [xpos],[ypos] in table [name] using data in variable [var]
tabw [name],[xpos],[ypos],[var]


The following share syntax with tabr, but have the following added actions:
tabcd: print raw character
tabdd: print data in decimal
tabtd: print data in ternary



-Building your tables works like so:
table [name],[width],[height]
tstr ABC
tstr 123
tstr .|.
tdat 10x1;+0-;:F

[name] is the table name of your table.
[width] is the table width in decimal
[height] is the table height in decimal

As you can see, the table is built of tstr and tdat statements.

tstr is handy for tables containing rows of only characters
tdat is semicolon-divided and accepts the same data value syntaxes as var and val. (shown)
