# SSTNPL modules

SSTNPL features a statically compiled module system.
the following is some brief documentation on its usage.

#### compiling modules.

in order to use an *.stnp file as a module, you need to compile it via 
stnpcom.py's module option:

via xas shell/xas script:

	stnp --module [modulename]
	stnp -m [modulename]


#### Including modules:


the module is specifed via its **basename**. 

**DO NOT** specify EITHER OF THE .tas0 OR .stnpmfs extensions. otherwise 
SSTNPL's compiler WILL NOT be able to load both the .stnpmfs and .tas0 files 
and will throw an error.

USE:

	include comprompt as cp

DO NOT USE:
	include comprompt.tas0 as cp
	include comprompt.stnpmfs as cp
BOTH OF THOSE WILL CAUSE AN ERROR!

#### module namespaces:

modules, contain unique namespaces for each "as *" label they are imported as.

###### EXAMPLE:
main contains:

	var sam=@1
	include bob as bob

bob: contains:

	var sam=@2

notice the two variables called 'sam'.

the one under 'main' can be refrenced as 'sam' directly, but not the other:

	dumpd sam

the 'sam' in the module included as 'bob', can be accessed as such:

	dumpd bob.sam

the effect is that both these variables are completely unique. this also stems
to labels, AND tables.
