functions:

where * is pointer number. legacy mempoint operations should default to pointer 0.

pt*set
pt*setdata
pt*get

pt*inc: increment
pt*dec: decrement

pt*inc2: increment though data then instruction for each address. so that : data1>inst1>data2>inst2
pt*dec2: decrement though instruction then data for each address. so that : inst2>data2>inst1>data1

pt*add1: add reg1 to pointer
pt*add2: add reg2 to pointer
pt*sub1: subtract reg1 from pointer
pt*sub2: subtract reg2 from pointer

pt*adddata add data to pointer
pt*subdata subtract data from pointer


pt*wri1 write reg1 value to pointer address
pt*wri2 write reg2 value to pointer address
pt*wridata write data value to pointer address


>>>these are changed by pt*inc2 and pt*dec2 automatically, but can be chosen manually.<<<
pt*inst: select instruction word bank (for pointer address)
pt*data: select data word bank (for pointer address)


pt*read1: read from pointer address into reg1
pt*read2: read from pointer address into reg1

pt*ioup: 'stream' pointer address data to io address specified as data.
pt*iodown: 'stream' data from io address in data to pointer address
