SBTCVM eXtensible Assembly Script (XAS) Interactive Shell mode help

When you run xas.py with no arguments, or with the -i option,
you will be greeted by a welcome message and a prompt. This is the
XAS interactive mode (AKA XAS shell)

The prompt looks like so:
>





In addition to the commands outlined in help_xas.txt, XAS' interactive shell
mode has the following interactive-only commands.:

find [string]: a case-insensitive file search function. 
	handy for remembering those pesky rom names and such.

list [path]: will either list the path verbatim, or if not found, search for the path in 
	ROMS, APPS, VMSYSTEM, VMUSER, and VMSYSTEM/ROMS,
	and then list any XAS-relavant files and directories it finds there.

help: a quick refresher on available commands

version/ver/info: version information

about: about the shell.



###Tips###

remember: often SBTCVM is able to find it by itself. find can help you here, as
		it searches the same locations as SBTCVM's file lookup routines.

Both recursive and auto directories can be listed by their name alone, and
		list should find them without needing their full path at all.
		i.e. to list the included gtt app's directory, enter 'list gtt' at
		the XAS prompt.

Recursive Directories: Any directory in ROMS, APPS, VMSYSTEM, VMUSER, or
		VMSYSTEM/ROMS, prefixed with 'r_' will be searched automatically by
		SBTCVM when opening things like source code and TROMs

'Auto' directories: Any directory in ROMS, APPS, VMSYSTEM, VMUSER, or
		VMSYSTEM/ROMS, may be matched as a particular file if it contains a
		file of that type prefixed with 'auto_' i.e. 'auto_build.xas' in that
		example, passing the directory to the xas command as a script will run
		'auto_build.xas'
