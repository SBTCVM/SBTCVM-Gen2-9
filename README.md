## What is SBTCVM?

Ever wonder what computers other than the boring-old binary would be like? Well, look no further!
SBTCVM, a python-written VM, simulates the little-known base number called Balanced Ternary!

What is balanced ternary? well, it has "0" and "+1", just like binary, 
but added into the mix is a "-1"! Yes, this means EVERY number is signed. 

Intrigued? Well, as
SBTCVM is Free & Open Source Software, and comes with a ready-to-use
set of compilers and development tools, Getting started with balanced 
ternary with SBTCVM, should prove a fun challenge!
