packtest2:
	A simple example of ternary-packed-art: 3-trit greyscale images in SBTCVM's TTY output.
	Note that the curses frontend, logs, and standard output, will use
	ascii aproximations in place of the graphical blocks the pygame frontend
	uses.

packtest3:
	Similar to packtest2, but with a basic example of custom ternary-packed-art
	colors. colors are NOT supported by curses.
vscroll:
	A massive 72x400 graphical scroller using Ternary-packed-art
	Art and Code: Thomas Leathers
	
	Meant partly as an example for anyone wanting a pixel-art challenge.

colortext:
	A demo of the pygame frontend's enhanced TTY color capacity:
	27-color 3-trit RGB color, for BOTH foreground and background!
	thats 729 foreground-background combinations!
	
	If you run this demo in the curses frontend, it will work, just without
	the colors. so using it DOES NOT break compatibility with the curses
	frontend.
