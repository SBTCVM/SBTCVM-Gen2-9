packtest2:
	A simple example of ternary-packed-art: 3-trit greyscale images in SBTCVM's TTY output.
	Note that the curses frontend, logs, and standard output, will use
	ascii aproximations in place of the graphical blocks the pygame frontend
	uses.

vscroll:
	A massive 72x400 graphical scroller using Ternary-packed-art
	Art and Code: Thomas Leathers
	
	Meant partly as an example for anyone wanting a pixel-art challenge.
