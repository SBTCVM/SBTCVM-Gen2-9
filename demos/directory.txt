key:
	[ttycolor] : uses tty color support.
	[mouse]    : uses the SBTCVM mouse device.
	[nocurses] : CANNOT be used in curses frontend.
	[sound]    : uses the SBTCVM sound chip (requires pygame. works in all frontends)

----Technical----

shelldemo:
	Uses SSTNPLs tabstrc instruction, and some stack/table-based input code,
	to create a command shell, complete with multi-character commands,
	with no restrictions on command names, other than an 80-character limit,
	and no cases as such:
			load
			load2
		is invalid. instead, when a command has a suffixed variant, do this:
			load1
			load2


----'demoscene-style demos'----
ternarydreams:
	This is a short, 2 KiloNonet (1000 word) SBTCVM plotter demo.
	features music.[sound][nocurses]

----Sound----

sounddemo:
	a basic automated test/example for SBTCVM's sound chip. [sound]
musicdemo:
	A demo of SBTCVM SIMPLE MUSIC ENGINE or 'musicengine' SSTNPL module.
	Features a loop of 3-note chords, that demos several different
	waveform/pan/pulse configurations. [sound]

----Terminal----

packtest2:
	A simple example of ternary-packed-art: 3-trit greyscale images in SBTCVM's TTY output.
	Note that the curses frontend, logs, and standard output, will use
	ascii aproximations in place of the graphical blocks the pygame frontend
	uses.

packtest3:
	Similar to packtest2, but with a basic example of custom ternary-packed-art
	colors. colors are NOT supported by curses. [ttycolors]
vscroll:
	A massive 72x400 graphical scroller using Ternary-packed-art
	Art and Code: Thomas Leathers
	
	Meant partly as an example for anyone wanting a pixel-art challenge.

colscroll:
	A 27-color version of vscroll [ttycolor] [nocurses]


colortext:
	A demo of the pygame frontend's enhanced TTY color capacity:
	27-color 3-trit RGB color, for BOTH foreground and background!
	thats 729 foreground-background combinations!
	
	If you run this demo in the curses frontend, it will work, just without
	the colors. so using it DOES NOT break compatibility with the curses
	frontend. [ttycolor]

colorpack:
	uses the 27-color 3-trit RGB variant of the basic ternary-packed-art
	system. [nocurses][ttycolor]

comppack:
	uses 27-color packart, but features a lossless compression algorithm 
	(gfxcon -cprle)
	Features example SSTNPL-based decoder algorithm. [nocurses][ttycolor]

----Plotter----

tritmap:
	A 243x243 PLRLE tritmap example. (a basic 9-trit RGB, per-line
	run-length compression scheme.) uses the 'plrle' SSTNPL module,
	and 'gfxcon -plrle' [nocurses]
	
burst:
	A nice 'ray burst' demo based upon a similar demo for SBTCVM Mark 2 (Gen 1)
	[nocurses]

doodle:
	A crude, mouse-based drawing demo using the plotter. [nocurses][mouse]
	
plottest:
	A basic example of SBTGA mode 30: plotter mode.
	This vector-based mode, cannot be engaged in the curses frontend, for 
	obvious reasons. It starts with a tty-mode-based explanation, switches to
	mode 30 for its demonstration, then switches back to tty mode.
	
	note: using any SBTGA mode other than 0 (tty mode), DOES break
	compatibility with the curses frontend. [nocurses]
