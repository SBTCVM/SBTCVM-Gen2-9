##SSTNPL Instruction test: uiter & diter


#uiter & diter are two wonderful instructions for looping subroutines.

#need to iterate over a table? no problem.
#need to run a subroutine on a linear range of numbers? no sweat. 

uiter: normal upward sweep. from START to END. START must be higher than END
diter: downward sweep. from START to END. END must be higer than START


#syntax:
#[u/d]iter [name],[subroutine],[start],[end]

#START and END can either be integer variables, or static decimal values
#	using the '@' syntax used in this test.

#SUBROUTINE is the associated label of the subroutine to be looped.

#NAME is a unique variable name (NO VAR STATEMENT REQUIRED)
#	NAME is used to provide the subroutine with an easy way of getting the
#	iterator's state.
